# my computer is a home that my friends can visit

[Welcome to my tiny folder party.](https://makeyour.computer/a/home)

Created with with this folder party generator.

## how this party is hosted

The `invitation/` is hosted through Netlify ([https://makeyour.computer/a/home](https://makeyour.computer/a/home)) and provides instructions for accessing the party. I don't have my computer's address listed publically, so you'll need the directions on the invitation.

The `party/` is hosted on a computer in my house and made available as an onion website using [Tor](https://torproject.org). Tor uses a worldwide network of volunteer-run servers to help people access websites anonymously and securely.

## host your own folder party

Try out the folder party generator for yourself. Instructions live at the [root of this repository](../../README.md).

I also have an in-progress [guide to self-hosting](https://self-host.lizz.website) your websites using Tor.
