# my computer is a home that my friends can visit

A website is just a collection of files in a folder.

Hosting a website is like inviting your friends over to a folder on your computer.

This is a folder party that I'll be hosting for a short while.

Created with my tiny [folder party generator](https://github.com/lizzthabet/make-your-computer-a-home).

## how this party is hosted

The `invitation/` is hosted through Netlify ([https://makeyour.computer/a-home](https://makeyour.computer/a-home)) and provides instructions for accessing the party. I don't have my computer's address listed publically, so you'll need the directions on the invitation.

The `party/` is hosted on a computer in my house and made available as an onion website using [Tor](https://torproject.org). Tor uses a worldwide network of volunteer-run servers to help people access websites anonymously and securely.

## host your own folder party

I wrote a tiny [folder party generator](https://github.com/lizzthabet/make-your-computer-a-home)! It's neat! Try it out and let me know what you think.

I also have an in-progress [guide to self-hosting](https://self-host.lizz.website) your websites using Tor.
