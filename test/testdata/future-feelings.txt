my therapist kept saying that anxiety is a feeling you have about the future. it is a collection of feelings you have about what has not happened yet, but could, might, or wont.

so what the fuck are we feeling right now? what are we feeling right now about the right now?

it cant be anxiety because anxiety is about the future. what the fuck is anxiety in the present. maybe i don't have any feelings about the present and only about the very near-term future -- or rather a definite future that i have no idea when it will occur -- and maybe the anxiety is not about a _what if_ but about a _how soon_? 

are any of your feelings about the present?
